            <h1>What we gonna learn in Unit 2 of LaunchCode's LC101 course</h1>
            <div id="introduction">
                <p>The goal of the Unit 2 is to give students a high-level overview of what is going on behind the scenes when students interact with a web application like Facebook or launchcode.org. Making the magic happen requires a large "stack" of technologies and programming languages working in tandem and communicating with each other. Some of these operations occur on separate physical computers - potentially in different parts of the world. We will touch briefly on many of the most fundamental pieces of this dance.</p>

                        <h2 class="objectives">CSS</h2>
                        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS.</p>

                        <h2 class="objectives">HTTP</h2>
                        <p>HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. WWW is about communication between web clients and servers. Communication between client computers and web servers is done by sending HTTP Requests and receiving HTTP Responses.</p>

                        <h2 class="objectives">Servers</h2>
                        <p>A server is a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to another computer over the internet or a local network. The word 'server' is understood by most to mean a web server where web pages can be accessed over the internet through a client like a web browser. However, there are several types of servers, including local ones like file servers that store data within an intranet network.</p>

                        <p>Front-end development manages everything that users visually see first in their browser or application. Front end developers are responsible for the look and feel of a site.<br /><br />Back-end development refers to the server side of an application and everything that communicates between the database and the browser.</p>

                        <h2 class="objectives">Templating systems</h2>
                        <p>A templating system provides a way of separating the code in a web page from the layout of that page. In larger projects, templates can be used to allow designers to deal exclusively with designing web pages and programmers to deal (more or less) exclusively with programming. The basic idea of a templating system is that the web page itself contains special markers that are replaced with dynamic content. A web designer can create the HTML for a page and simply worry about the layout, using the appropriate markers for different kinds of dynamic content that are needed. The programmer, on the other hand, is responsible for creating the code that generates the dynamic content for the markers.</p>

                        <p>The collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Query language is primarily created for creating, accessing, and modifying data in and out from a database management system (DBMS). Typically, QL requires users to input a structured command that is similar and close to the English language querying construct.</p>

                        <h2 class="objectives">Cookies</h2>
                        <p>An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie, or simply cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past).</p>

                        <p>The model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern specifies that an application consist of a data model, presentation information, and control information. The pattern requires that each of these be separated into different objects.</p>
